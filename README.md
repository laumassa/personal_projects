# personal_projects

This repository showcases my personal data analysis projects, where I explore and apply various techniques to enhance my skills and tackle new challenges. I work with diverse datasets from institutions like Statbel (Belgian Statistics Institute) and Eurostat, leveraging data collection methods (APIs, web scraping), data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful insights.

I primarily use Python and SQL, with libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation. For data visualization, I work with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Additionally, I apply machine learning techniques using Scikit-learn to develop predictive models and deepen my analytical approach.
